## Introduction

This repository contains instructions for building and deploying a MNIST digit prediction model using:

 - Model Building: [Watson Studio](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/watson-studio) (using [Neural Network designer](https://datascience.ibm.com/docs/content/analyze-data/ml-canvas-nnd-intro.html?context=analytics))
 - Model Deployment: [Watson Machine Learning](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/machine-learning)

## Instructions

### Download neural network flow design

The sample MNIST flow provided with IBM Watson Studio's Neural Network designer has a low accuracy.  The first thing we need to do is create a new flow.

You can download the improved flow from here: [CNN MNIST](./CNN_MNIST.nnd)

### Create new flow design

More steps coming soon ...
